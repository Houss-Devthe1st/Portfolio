My personal portfolio, showing bio, details and my recent projects tools and frameworks used:

Tailwind CSS
Flowbite
HTML
CSS (inline and block)
JavaScript
Web3Forms API
Google Fonts
A quick intro about me and my services, where you can:

Download my resume/CV
Click on a "contact me" button that will redirect you to a form at the end of the portfolio to send me a message via email
Check out the "My Latest work" block, there I added links to other pages that explain my projects a little more in detail. each page will show you either videos, screenshots and description of each feature included
The contact form works, using an API from web3forms, allowing anyone to send me an email. Of course there is a email validity check in the "Email" input block My Email, LinkedIn and Instagram (only for now) are both included in my footer.

I made it as interactive as possible (not too much, not too little), I tried to make each project page meaningful and not too focused on explaining every detail in it.
